# Spotify-Larger-Variety-Project

Often, Spotify users will start listening to music that is similar to what they listen to. This sometimes puts listeners into a bubble instead of expanding the user's listening range. 
This project changes that. Using a database of 175k+ songs on Spotify, this project will give you a playlist of songs that may be outside the genres and artists the user typically listens to. The goal is that the user will be able to experience new taste and discover new music that might appeal to them. 
By passing in a playlist with songs from the database (not all songs in the playlist have to be in the database for it to work), the algorithm will generate a new playlist that will show up in the user's playlist list under the title they chose. 

Enjoy!

The database is from Kaggle and can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks

Thank you to Marc Jiang for being my project mentor and guiding me through this project. This helped me learn so much along the way!
